Filtering Patterns: Simple filter; Bloom filter(efficient probabilistic filter); Sampling; Random sampling; Top N records;

Summarization Patterns: counting records; min/max; statistics; create inverted index;

Structural Patterns(Structured to Hierarchical Pattern): combining data sets; it is a pattern you use if you ever migrate data from relational data base management systems to a Hadoop system. 
In order to use this pattern, 
1. data source must be linked by some foreign keys;
2. data must be structured and row based.
