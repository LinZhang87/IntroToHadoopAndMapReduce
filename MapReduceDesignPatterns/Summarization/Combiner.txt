To use combiner, you will have to add a new shortcut command to your VM. In the terminal window type

gedit ~/.bashrc
In the editor that opens, find a function definition "run_mapreduce". Copy the contents and create a new function (within the same file), let's say "run_mapreduce_with_combiner". Add the following "-combiner $2" right after "-reducer $2".

And at the end of the file, add a line for the alias:

alias hsc=run_mapreduce_with_combiner
(or whatever you called that function). You can also change the alias itself, just make sure you are not trying to use any already existing Linux command names.

Now save the file and exit the gedit program. Run the following in the terminal:

source ~/.bashrc
This will reload the configuration file you just edited, and your new alias should be ready to use.

The new alias will take the second parameter (which is the reducer script) and also use it for combiner. If you want, you can actually make another alias, that allows you to use a different script for combiner. You would need to also -upload it, same as you did for mapper and reducer scripts.
